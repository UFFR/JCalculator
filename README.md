# JCalculator
A simple command-line Java calculator program. Features basic arithmetic and trigonometric functions. Runs using a Pratt-like parsing algorithm.
Not very complicated at the moment, but I hope to add more features and accurate calculating.

## Feature List:
 - Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 - Square roots.
 - Exponents.
 - Absolute value.
 - Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent, as well as their ^-1 versions.
 - Simple parenthesis to force evaluation of certain parts.
 - Implicit multiplication.
 - Variables (not fully compatible with implicit multiplication).
